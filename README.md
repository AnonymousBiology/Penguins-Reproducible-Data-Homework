# Penguins-Reproducible-Data-Homework

This document contains the directory for my code ```Reproducible Data Homework.Rproj```, the r-markdown file containing the homework answers ```Assignment_Answers.Rmd```, an html knitted copy of my homework answers ```Assignment_Answers.html```, and three folders: a **Data** folder containing my raw and cleaned datasets, a **Figures** folder containing png and svg images of the plots I produced, and a **Functions** folder containing the code for the functions I used in my project.
